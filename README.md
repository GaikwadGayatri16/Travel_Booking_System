# Travel_Booking_System
 A travel booking system is a digital platform that streamlines the process of searching, 
             comparing, and reserving travel services like flights, hotels, and car rentals. It features a 
             user-friendly interface, real-time availability, and dynamic packaging options for customized
             travel experiences. Payment processing is simplified with multiple online options, while 
             integration with global distribution systems (GDS) expands inventory access. The system
             enhances operational efficiency and customer satisfaction through centralized management
             and reporting capabilities. Ultimately, it empowers travel agencies to optimize their offerings
             and increase revenue opportunities in a competitive market.
